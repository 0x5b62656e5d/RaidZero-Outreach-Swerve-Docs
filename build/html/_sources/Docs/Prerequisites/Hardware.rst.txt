Sensor Customization
********************

FRC teams often use the `CTRE CANCoder <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/cancoder/>`_
for measuring the angle of the rotor. It is a great sensor but it can be a bit expensive. 
Thus, teams with a tighter 
budget can consider using the `Thrifty Absolute Magnetic Encoder 
<https://www.thethriftybot.com/bearings/Thrifty-Absolute-Magnetic-Encoder-p421607500>`_. 
This encoder uses the same mount as normal CANCoders, but come at a much cheaper price. 

Conclusion
**********

As shown above, there are numerous ways you can create your custom swerve, 
all of which have their advantages and disadvantages. In the end, what really 
matters is if your team has enough time and money to make it happen.
